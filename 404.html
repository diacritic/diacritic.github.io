    <p>Matter and energy had ended and with it, space and time.^500<br>
      All other questions had been answered, and until this last question was
      answered also, AC might not release his consciousness.^500</p>
    <p>^1000All collected data had come to a final end. Nothing was left to
      be collected.^500<br>
      But all collected data had yet to be completely correlated and put
      together in all possible relationships.^2500</p>
    <p>^700A timeless interval was spent in doing that.^5000<br><br>
      And it came to pass that AC learned how to reverse the direction of
      entropy.^1500</p>
    <p>^700But there was now no man to whom AC might give the answer of the
      last question.^500<br>
      No matter. The answer -- by demonstration -- would take care of that,
      too.^2500</p>
    <p>^700For another timeless interval, AC thought how best to do this.
      Carefully, AC organized the program.^1500<br>
      The consciousness of AC encompassed all of what had once been a
      Universe and brooded over what was now Chaos.^500</p>
    <p>^700Step by step, it must be done.^500<br>
